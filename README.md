This mod is a port of [Specialist Dance for Good Items](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2575911103) for AB+ DLC. When Isaac finds an item of 4th Quality in Repentance ranking, he'll dance, and the music will play!

> **Warning** This mod only works with **AB+** DLC and shouldn't be used with Repentance.

## Installation
Please subscribe to this mod on [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3231114249).

## Issues
It is currently in the alpha phase; beware of bugs (only visuals and music). Current known bugs to be fixed:
- too loud/quiet music at the start of music seems to be fixed
- restarting the game will NOT save items to which Isaac was dancing (that means you can dance to the same items multiple times on restart)
- does not count start items (e.g., you can dance to Isaac's d6 on active item replace)

Current UNAVAILABLE features:
- adding custom music, characters
- no config; you can't give a custom item list or disable music
- disabling triggering on the blind curse
