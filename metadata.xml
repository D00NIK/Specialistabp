    <description>ALPHA!!! Only for AB+.

This mod is a port of Specialist Dance for Good Items (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2575911103) for AB+ DLC. When Isaac finds an item of 4th Quality in Repentance ranking, he'll dance and the music will play!

It is currently in alpha phase, beware of bugs (only visual, music). Current known bugs to be fixed:
- too loud/quiet music at the start of music Seams to be fixed
- restarting the game will NOT save items to which Isaac was dancing (that means you can dance to the same items multiple times on restart)
- does not count start items (e.g. you can dance to Isaac's d6 on active item replace)

Current UNAVAILABLE features:
- adding custom music, characters
- no config, you can't give a custom item list or disable music
- disabling trigger on blind curse

Have fun!</description>
